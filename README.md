At its core, Vibes runs on a robust backend architecture:
1. **Django Server**: Powers our innovative image-to-text-to-speech, image-to-text-to-audio, and image-to-text-to-music functionalities, alongside our unique text-to-music models.
2. **AWS Lambda Functions**: Manage user authentication, posts management, and interaction with our **Postgres database** for a scalable and efficient infrastructure.
3. **State-of-the-Art Models**: Vibes leverages cutting-edge technology to revolutionize content creation:
	- _Meta's MusicGen_: Our backbone for audio generation, enhanced with a fine-tuned GPT for superior results, transcending the capabilities of MusicGen Vanilla.
		- Custom Deployment: A dedicated T4 GPU hosts our bespoke version of MusicGen on AWS through HuggingFace, offering unparalleled performance and creativity.
	- __Vision and Theme Generation__: GPT-4 Vision for precise image inputs and a fine-tuned GPT for generating immersive themes and genres, setting a new standard in content creation synergy.

## It was not easy.
- Ideation in a Competitive Landscape: Breaking new ground in generative AI, where **every conceivable solution seems already claimed by heavily funded entities**, posed a significant creative challenge. Ideating a unique value proposition for Vibes demanded **deep market insights and inventive thinking**.

- Resource Scarcity and Innovation: Securing a GPU amidst a market shortage required ingenuity. We embraced this challenge by leveraging Hugging Face, creating a **custom handler for our MusicGen instance** to ensure precise **tensor outputs**, seamlessly convertible into wav files.

- Architectural Adaptability: Our vision of a completely serverless architecture met with the **limitations of Lambda functions**, notably their 30-second timeout. Adapting swiftly, we engineered a **Django server on EC2**, an improvisation executed merely six hours before submission, showcasing our team's agility and technical acumen.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our crowning achievement lies in transforming Vibes from concept to reality, crafting a fully functional product without "hacks". The collaborative synergy between just two minds not only powered us through challenges but also resulted in a robust platform, ready to transcend the hackathon and make a lasting impact in the real world.
